# Install

First of all, you need to install the latest version of [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). We'll take advantage of **NPM**.

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or your favorite IDE for React development.

If you choose the VS Code IDE then you may find the fallowing extensions very useful: 

* Simple React Snippets by Burke Holland
* Prettier - Code Formater by Esben Peterson

# Coding config file

After that is time to setup few more things in VS Code. We'll editing the **Settings.json**. To do that on Mac you need to go to: 

* Preferences
* Settings
* Click on the **...** button from the right 
* Open the Settings.json
* Copy and paste the fallowing lines of code

```
{
  "window.zoomLevel": -1,  
  "git.enableSmartCommit": true,  
  "editor.fontSize": 15,  
  "editor.tabSize": 2,  
  "editor.formatOnSave": true   
}
```

* Do not forget to save the .json file

# Debugging

You can debug React apps in Google Chrome. To do that you need to install the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) chrome extension.
